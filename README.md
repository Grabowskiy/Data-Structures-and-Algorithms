### Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

I made this repository, because I believe the best way to learn something is to 
understand it from the ground up. I was familiar with the theoretical concepts behind 
most of these data structures and algorithms, but most of them I have never implemented.
In this repo I will implement various algorithms and concepts using many programming languages
to further deepen my knowledge in data science. My goal is to enhance my understanding through 
hands-on practice and to document my learning.
